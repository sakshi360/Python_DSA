'''' Problem Statement - find middle of linked list.
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.

'''We can traverse through the Linked List while maintaining a count of nodes letâ€™s say in variable n, and then traversing for 2nd time for n/2 nodes to get 
the middle of the list.

'''Tortoise Method
In the Tortoise-Hare approach, we increment slow ptr by 1 and fast ptr by 2, so if take a close look fast ptr will travel double that of the slow pointer.
So when the fast ptr will be at the end of the Linked List, slow ptr would have covered half of the Linked List till then.
So slow ptr will be pointing towards the middle of Linked List.'''
